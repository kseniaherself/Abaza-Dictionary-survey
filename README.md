# Abaza-Dictionary-survey
This is a repository for the project of my MA practice, supervisor D. Ryzhova. 

The repository contains: 
- jupyter noteook file `ttabz.ipynb` with general code
- the folder `a_letter` with loaded relevant pages from the dictionary page of *a*
- file `wordlist.txt` with the list of these words
- primary construct of the output table `table_words.tsv` with only **ID** and **words** filled

There are 694 words for now.
